# Non-Functional Requirements

This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the LibraryApp system. These requirements define the system's quality attributes and constraints.

## 1. Security

*   **SEC-001**: All communication between the client and the server must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
*   **SEC-002**: User passwords must be hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt).
*   **SEC-003**: Authentication tokens (JWTs) must be stored securely on the client and should not be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **SEC-004**: The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and XSS.
*   **SEC-005**: Role-based access control (RBAC) must be implemented to ensure that users can only access the features and data that they are authorized to.

## 2. Performance

*   **PERF-001**: The API should respond to 95% of requests within 500ms.
*   **PERF-002**: The database should be able to handle at least 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
*   **PERF-003**: The web application should load in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

## 3. Scalability

*   **SCALE-001**: The application should be designed to be scalable horizontally by adding more web servers.
*   **SCALE-002**: The database should be scalable vertically by increasing its resources (CPU, RAM, storage).

## 4. Fault Tolerance

*   **FT-001**: The system should be able to handle the failure of a single web server without affecting the availability of the application.
*   **FT-002**: The system should have a backup and recovery plan in place to protect against data loss.
*   **FT-003**: The system should log all critical errors and provide a mechanism for alerting administrators.
