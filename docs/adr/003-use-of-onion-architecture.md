# ADR-003: Use of Onion Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-22

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

We need to structure our application in a way that is maintainable, testable, and scalable. The chosen architecture should promote a separation of concerns and reduce coupling between the different parts of the application.

## Decision

We have chosen to use the Onion Architecture for our backend application. This architecture places the domain model at the center of the application and ensures that all dependencies flow inwards. The UI, infrastructure, and other external concerns are kept at the edges of the architecture.

## Consequences

### Advantages

*   **Maintainability**: The separation of concerns makes it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.
*   **Testability**: The loose coupling between layers makes it easy to write unit tests for the application's business logic.
*   **Scalability**: The modular nature of the architecture makes it easy to scale the application by adding new features or replacing existing ones.
*   **Flexibility**: The architecture allows us to easily swap out external dependencies, such as the database or the UI framework.

### Disadvantages

*   **Complexity**: The Onion Architecture can be more complex to set up than a traditional layered architecture.
*   **Learning Curve**: Developers who are not familiar with the Onion Architecture may need some time to get used to it.
